# Notepad-Syntax
This is the Syntax Support for Notepad++.  All you need to do is download them then go into Notepad++ and go to `Language->User Defined Language->Import` and select both of the two syntaxes then your done!

Note: Check out the proper [spec](https://github.com/DOML-DataOrientedMarkupLanguage/DOML-Spec) if you want to see what this language can do and how to use it, for the sake of simplicity I won't repeat myself here.  Furthermore this is 100% compliant with the current spec.
